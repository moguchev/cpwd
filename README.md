## cpwd v0.0.0 â€” tiny and handy password manager

cpwd is simple, stateless password manager. You enter a master key and the name of an account (ex. "gmail"), wait a few seconds, and cpwd generates a password for that account ready in your clipboard. You can reuse the same master key for all your accounts, and cpwd will generate a different strong password for every account. Every time you want to log in, just launch cpwd and enter the same master key and account name. Simple! Useful!

### Benefits
1. Memorize a single master key, but still get a different strong password for every account.
2. Quick and easy command-line access.
3. Copies password straight to clipboard then clears clipboard automatically in 10 seconds.
4. Doesn't store anything: no password databases to manage.

### Usage
1. Run `cpwd [-r] [%account_name%]`, ex. `cpwd`, `cpwd twitter`, `cpwd -r`, `cpwd -r reddit`. Adding `-r` allows you to run cpwd in registration mode where you need to enter master key twice to avoid errors. It's very useful when you're registering or changing password somewhere. Adding `%account_name%` allows you to skip entering account name in dialog mode.
2. Enter your master key (hidden, same for all accounts).
3. In a few seconds, your password for that account is in your clipboard. Clipboard is cleared automatically after 15 seconds for security.

### Notes
1. **Weak master key ruins everything**. Your master key should have at least 8 characters, contain lowercase and uppercase letters, numbers and special symbols.
2. Key derivation is done with [scrypt](https://www.tarsnap.com/scrypt.html), account name acts as salt. Parameters: N = 2<sup>17</sup> = 131072, r = 8, p = 1, L = 16. Generated passwords contain 32 symbols from 0123456789abcdef set.
3. Account names are lowercased automatically for usability. "GitHub" == "github".

### Platforms
* Linux (tested)
* Mac OS X (tested), OpenBSD and other UNIXes (supported)
* Windows and other OSes (not supported)

### Installation
1. `git clone https://github.com/moguchev/cpwd.git` to download repository.
2. Build cpwd. On *nix systems with GCC you can do it via running `make build` script.
3. Linux/OpenBSD only: install `xclip` package for working with clipboard (you can use `xsel` package aswell, just edit the main.c for a bit).

### Tips on cpwd launching speed-up
1. On *nix: add a lines `alias p='/path/to/./cpwd'` and `alias r='/path/to/./cpwd -r'` in your `.bashrc` file for adding two commands to your shell: `p` that launches cpwd in normal mode and `r` that launches cpwd in registration mode.
2. On Windows: for faster launching cpwd via `p` and `r` commands in cmd you can create two batch scripts in some directory that's shown as result of `path` command in cmd: `p.bat` containing a line `@echo off && call "C:\path\to\cpwd.exe"` and `r.bat` containing a line `@echo off && call "C:\path\to\cpwd.exe -r"`.

### Tips on cpwd computing speed-up
1. Check if your processor supports SSE (on *nix just run `grep sse /proc/cpuinfo` to do it). If it does, compile against crypto_scrypt-sse.c instead of crypto_scrypt-nosse.c (and if you use GCC, add a flag `-march=native`).
2. Enable optimization in your compiler. If you use GCC, you can do it with flags `-march=native` (compile just for current processor) plus `-O1` (recommended) or `-O2` or `-O3` (not recommended). Test them all and use the best for you.
